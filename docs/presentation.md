# Meet Peichi 

### An Operation Specialist's Daily Challenge:

- Managing 10+ events per month
- 50s of speaker portraits to process
- JPG, PNG, WEBP files flooding her inbox
- Different sizes, backgrounds, formats
- Hours spent on manual photo editing

# A Day in Peichi's Life (Before) 

### For Each Speaker Photo:
1. Download from email
2. Open in photo editor
3. Crop manually
4. Convert format
5. Resize for website
6. Save and organize

*Multiply this by 10 speakers per event...*

- Event website launch tomorrow
- 50 speaker photos still need processing
- Clock showing 11 PM
- Coffee getting cold
- Then she discovered **FaceCrop**
